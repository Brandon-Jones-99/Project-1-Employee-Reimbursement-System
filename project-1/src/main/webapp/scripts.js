I WOULD LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS PROJECT TO DEZEL DAVIS, MY SENPAI AND FELLOW REVATURE TRAINEE


HE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WITH ME, WITH PATIENCE AND SELFLESSNESS, AND HAS HELPED ME MORE TIMES 
THAN I CAN REMEMBER WITH TROUBLESHOOTING, EXPLAINING NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND HELPING ME PUSH THROUGH
WHEN I WANTED TO QUIT (AND THEN MORE TROUBLESHOOTING)


IF YOU'RE READING THIS, KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR WITHOUT YOU 



* SEE YA LATER, SPACE COWBOY *
